# 🌐 Web Design Learning Journey

Welcome to my web design learning repository!  
Here, I document my progress while learning **HTML, CSS, and basic front-end concepts** through small projects and exercises.

Each folder contains:
- Example code (`.html`, `.css`)
- A short explanation (`README.md`)
- Related images in a local `images/` folder

---

## 🧭 Goals
- Build a solid understanding of web fundamentals.
- Practice creating responsive layouts.
- Share exercises and mini-projects as part of my portfolio.
